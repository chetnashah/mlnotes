### Laws regarding text statistics:

- Zipf's Law: Some words will be frequent and some words will be rare. E.g. usually when you rank word occurence in a corpus by freqeunce, 'of' and 'the' make up 10% of all occuring words.
Crucial observation: rank of word times its probability(frequency) is approximately constant.
General family of datasets satisfying
such properties is: power-law distributions.

- Benford's Law:
First digit of naturally occuring numbers(not random),
follow a function

- Heaps Law
Experiment: read a book/newspaper/website
  * record everytime you see a new word, total number of new words being v.
  * total no. of words in corpus is n.
  * plot v against n
  * growth of new words (vocabulary growth) is square root in number of total words. 



- clumping nature of words
You rarely see a word occuring, but once occured you are much more likely to see it again.
