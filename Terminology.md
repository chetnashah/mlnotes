#### Parameters/Coefficients/Weights

A model parameter is a configuration variable that is internal to the model and whose value can be estimated from data.
e.g.

Some examples of model parameters include:

- The weights in an artificial neural network.
- The support vectors in a support vector machine.
- The coefficients in a linear regression or logistic regression.

#### HyperParameters

A model hyperparameter is a configuration that is external to the model and whose value cannot be estimated from data.

- They are often used in processes to help estimate model parameters.
- They are often specified by the practitioner.
- They can often be set using heuristics.
- They are often tuned for a given predictive modeling problem.

Some examples of model hyperparameters include:

- The learning rate for training a neural network.
- The C and sigma hyperparameters for support vector machines.
- The k in k-nearest neighbors.
